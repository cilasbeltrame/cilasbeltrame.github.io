By day, I'm a DevOps Engineer, freelancer, and make sure things donâ€™t catch fire (too often). By night, I break things in my homelab. ðŸš€

Iâ€™m a DevOps enthusiast who loves digging into Linux, Kubernetes, open source, and all  automation things. This blog is my little corner of the internet where I share what I learn/the wins, failures, and everything in between.

Letâ€™s build, break, and learn together! ðŸš€
